## Synopsis

This small script for the [Hubot chat bot](https://hubot.github.com/) simply returns info from [Beer Advocate](http://beeradvocate.com) for any search terms given.

## Use

`@hubot beer me <search-query>`

## Motivation

A win for the team at work started a discussion about breakfast beers the next time we meet (we're remote workers). Since Hubot is such a huge part of our online culture, it seemed only natural that we should be able to ask him for help in choosing.

## Installation

Simply place in your hubot's scripts folder.
